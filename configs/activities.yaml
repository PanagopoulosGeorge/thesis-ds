# Activity Definitions for MSA Dataset

activities:

  meet:
    type: "meet"
    description: "A meet activity occurs when two or more people come together from different locations"
    context: "Video surveillance scenarios where people converge at a location"
    examples:
      - "Two people approaching each other and stopping to talk"
      - "Multiple people gathering at a meeting point"
      - "People converging at an entrance or exit"
    constraints:
      - "Must track multiple person entities"
      - "Requires spatial proximity calculation"
      - "Minimum duration for valid meeting"
    ground_truth_file: "data/msa/ground_truth/meet.pl"
    
  moving:
    type: "moving"
    description: "A moving activity represents continuous motion of a person or object"
    context: "Tracking movement patterns in surveillance video"
    examples:
      - "Person walking across the scene"
      - "Vehicle driving through the area"
      - "Object being transported"
    constraints:
      - "Minimum displacement threshold"
      - "Continuous tracking required"
      - "Speed and direction calculations"
    ground_truth_file: "data/msa/ground_truth/moving.pl"
    
  leaving_object:
    type: "leaving_object"
    description: "Activity where a person leaves an object behind and moves away"
    context: "Security-relevant scenario for abandoned object detection"
    examples:
      - "Person placing a bag and walking away"
      - "Dropping an item and continuing without it"
      - "Deliberately leaving an object at a location"
    constraints:
      - "Track both person and object entities"
      - "Spatial relationship between person and object"
      - "Temporal threshold for abandonment"
    ground_truth_file: "data/msa/ground_truth/leaving_object.pl"
    
  fight:
    type: "fight"
    description: "Physical altercation between two or more people"
    context: "Security and safety monitoring in public spaces"
    examples:
      - "Two people in physical conflict"
      - "Group altercation with rapid movements"
      - "Aggressive physical interaction"
    constraints:
      - "High motion activity detection"
      - "Close proximity of participants"
      - "Sudden movement patterns"
    ground_truth_file: "data/msa/ground_truth/fight.pl"
    
  abrupt:
    type: "abrupt"
    description: "Sudden change in motion or behavior pattern"
    context: "Anomaly detection in normal movement patterns"
    examples:
      - "Person suddenly changing direction"
      - "Rapid acceleration or deceleration"
      - "Unexpected stop or start of movement"
    constraints:
      - "Velocity change threshold"
      - "Direction change angle threshold"
      - "Time window for change detection"
    ground_truth_file: "data/msa/ground_truth/abrupt.pl"
